\section{Challenges}

In the attempt to tackle the problem, various challenges arise that are worth mentioning.
%\subsection{Feature Selection}
%
%As mentioned in Section~\ref{Sec:data_set}, Kaggle provides a comprehensive set of various data which might be useful for us. However, we have to choose the features that satisfy the two criteria of usefulness and relevance to tackle this problem.

\subsection{Feature Selection}

Features are pieces of information that may be useful for predictions. It is generous of Kaggle to provide a comprehensive collection of data. However, not all data is relevant to making predictions. Before a set of features can be selected, careful choices must be made on which data sets to use and which portion of that data set is relevant to solving the problem. 

Regardless of the machine-learning technique used, the most obvious choice of data sets to use is the historical match records for both regular and tournament seasons. However, some data sets contain match records that date back to as early as 1985, which are no longer relevant in today's context. After all, the NCAA tournament teams consist of \emph{college students} who can only stay with a team for a maximum of four years before graduation. As players constantly leave and join the team, it is difficult to quantify the effect brought by changes in a team's composition on the strength of that team, given only the team-level data. Moreover, there were some substantial updates on the Tournament's rules at the beginning of the 2008-2009 season~\cite{NP15}, which also affected the strategies teams used in the subsequent tournaments. Therefore, only the most recent match records are useful for prediction. For the purpose of this project, a four-year window from 2013 to 2016 is selected and all data used in this project fall within this window. In addition, only the match records from the regular seasons are actually used, since there are only a few records from the tournament seasons which add little value to making predictions. 

There are a number of potential features that can be selected from the data set \textbf{RegularSeasonDetailedResult}. The potential features are further categorised as basic and additional features. Table~\ref{Ta:basic_feature} gives a summary of the basic features. 

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Wteam & The id number of the team that won the game \\ \hline
Wscore & The number of points scored by the winning team \\ \hline
Lteam & The id number of the team that lost the game \\ \hline
Lscore & The number of points scored by the losing team \\ \hline
Wloc & The location of the winning team \\ \hline
Numot & The number of overtime periods in the game \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
%}
\caption{A Summary of the Basic Features}\label{Ta:basic_feature}
\end{table}

The additional features describe both \emph{offensive} and \emph{defensive} strengths of both winning team and losing team. Table~\ref{Ta:offensive_feature} gives a summary of features describing offensive strengths, while Table~\ref{Ta:defensive_feature} focuses on defensive strengths. Although the two tables list features from the winning team's perspective, another duplicated set of features also exist for the losing team. 

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Wfgm & The number of field goals made by the winning team\\ \hline
Wfgm3 & The number of three pointers made by the winning team \\ \hline
Wftm & The number of free throws made by the winning team \\ \hline
Wor & The number of offensive rebounds by the winning team \\ \hline
Wast & The number of assists by the winning team \\ \hline
Wstl & The number of steals by the winning team \\ \hline
Wblk & The number of blocks by the winning team \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Wfta & The number of free throws attempted by the winning team\\ \hline
Wdr & The number of defensive rebounds by the winning team \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Complex Interrelationship}

No team is in isolation. The tournament matches are interactive processes whereby complex interrelationships exist amongst all the contesting teams, which adds another layer of complication in the attempt to predict match results. For example, given the history match records that Team A beaten Team B and Team C lost to Team B, one should intuitively conclude that Team A should have a higher probability of beating Team C. But what if another record shows that Team A once lost to Team C? In that case, the relative strength levels of the three teams will be hard to determine. Moreover, the match whose result is to be predicted may be the very \emph{first} match ever between two teams. In other words, there are no historical records that give a direct assessment on the two teams' strengths. Such lack of knowledge must be complemented by some interrelationships amongst the teams. So a good predictive model should not only be able to take into consideration the current game record, but also explore the interrelationships amongst all the game records and generalise on unseen matches. 

\subsection{The Curse of Model Popularity}
